# Beginnings...

Entry #1 - 18 June 2019

My name is Ricardo, and I am three weeks into my bootcamp for Software Development at Flatirons School! I'm coming into this program with very little coding knowledge. Like many others, I tried learning on my own and it took me a while to realize that I wasn't getting anywhere fast enough. So, I finally looked into coding schools and *poof* here I am. Very, very tired but in spite of that I'm enjoying it. Some days are better than others, for sure. Some days I feel at the top of my game, others I just want to go home and sleep for a whole day.

At first, it was tough getting into the groove of things. The schedule switch to basically working a full-time job with a lot of extra hours, being a night-owl, having to ride my bike to school, not having a full-time job for the last couple of years, gaming almost every night for the last... well, you get the picture. I WAS NOT PREPARED. Ehem... WoW reference. Oh, and that's a video game, if you're still completely lost. Anyway...

The first week came and went in a flash. I was learning a lot, I was overwhelmed, I wanted to do everything I could to get ahead. The second week I was just in survival mode. Code challenges kicked in so I had to basically prove through it that I was good enough to stay in the program. Now that I'm in my third week and I'm working on a project that's due later this same week, I feel great! Oh, and these blog posts are also a requirement... so, yeah, busy work.

Something I was pleasantly surprised about is the people I've met. The students in our class, or rather "cohort", are all from different walks in life, from all over, and with completely different personalities but we all share this experience and that makes us immediately friends (at least from my optimistic point of view). The instructors and the students in the other cohorts are also pretty friendly and don't mind helping out so that's great! Soo yeah, very glad that all these people around me seem very friendly - the last thing I wanted was some sort of drama in this intense setting... Knock on wood.

Now that I've shared a little bit of my background and the setting, I can start sharing some of the things I've learned with you. Hopefully you find this blog somewhat interesting!
